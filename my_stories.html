                <h5>The idea is to share stories I know and present them in my narrative with illustrations for children's.</h5>
                <br>
                <!--<p style="text-align:justify;">There is plenty of beautiful stories I know. Many stories 
                  I learned from my grandparents and many more I read and heard during my childhood. 
                  Beautiful stories from Egyptian, Hindu, Greek, and Roman mythologies. 
                  Countless folklore stories from all around the world, along with my own stories 
                  from a Microhistorical perspective. I always felt these stories more fascinating 
                  than the marvel universe and DC comics. These are the stories being forgotten by our children, 
                  so we need to share them with our future generations. I hope to fill this space with beautiful 
                  stories and make it a story repository with the collaboration of likely minded people. Unfortunately, 
                  at present, I am too busy and completely engaged with my work and research, so it is more like a 
                  retirement project.</p>-->
